# Belly Button Diversity Dashboard 

The dataset in *samples.json* is made up of data collected from test subjects that partcipated in a study to examine the biodiversity of their belly buttons. Each subjects' ethnicity, gender, age, location, belly button type, and their belly button washing frequency was collected. A dashboard to visualize this data was created with the *index.html* file and all of the charts displayed on the page were created in the *charts.js* file. When navigating the page, you can select a subject's id and the dashboard will refresh with all of the data corresponding to that subject. You will see their demographic info along with three charts. The three charts are:
* A bar chart that gives you the top 10 bacteria cultures found in their bellybutton
* A guage chart taht gives you a guage of how frequently they wash their belly button
* A bubble chart taht gives you the number of bacteria cultures found per sample
